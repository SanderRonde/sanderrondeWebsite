# www.sanderron.de (or sanderronde.nl or sanderronde.com)

My personal website.

Built with my own [wc-lib](https://github.com/sanderronde/wc-lib) library on the frontend and express on the backend.

## Running

First build everything, using `yarn build`, then run everything using `yarn start`.

## Development

Run `yarn watch` in one terminal to keep the TS compiled and the HTML typings updated (as well as some other things), and run `yarn dev` in another terminal to run the website itself. The browser will hot-reload as you make changes to the frontend and the backend will reload when you make changes to it as well.
